Mercurial is a distributed revision control tool for software developers. It is supported on Microsoft Windows,
Linux, and other Unix-like systems, such as FreeBSD and macOS.

Mercurial's major design goals include high performance and scalability, decentralization, fully distributed
collaborative development, robust handling of both plain text and binary files, and advanced branching
and merging capabilities, while remaining conceptually simple. It includes an integrated web-interface.
Mercurial has also taken steps to ease the transition for users of other version control systems, particularly
Subversion. Mercurial is primarily a command-line driven program, but graphical user interface extensions
are available, e.g. TortoiseHg, and several IDEs offer support for version control with Mercurial.
All of Mercurial's operations are invoked as arguments to its driver program hg (a reference to Hg â€“ the chemical
symbol of the element mercury).

Olivia Mackall originated Mercurial and served as its lead developer until late 2016. Mercurial is released
as free software under the GPL-2.0-or-later license. It is mainly implemented using the Python programming
language, but includes a binary diff implementation written in C.

Mackall first announced Mercurial on 19 April 2005. The impetus for this was the announcement earlier
that month by Bitmover that they were withdrawing the free version of BitKeeper because of the development
of SourcePuller.

BitKeeper had been used for the version control requirements of the Linux kernel project. Mackall decided to
write a distributed version control system as a replacement for use with the Linux kernel. This project started
a few days after the now well-known Git project was initiated by Linus Torvalds with similar aims.
