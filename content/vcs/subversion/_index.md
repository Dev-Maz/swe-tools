Apache Subversion (often abbreviated SVN, after its command name svn) is a version control system distributed
as open source under the Apache License. Software developers use Subversion to maintain current and historical
versions of files such as source code, web pages, and documentation. Its goal is to be a mostly compatible
successor to the widely used Concurrent Versions System (CVS).

The open source community has used Subversion widely: for example, in projects such as Apache Software Foundation,
FreeBSD, SourceForge, and from 2006 to 2019, GCC. CodePlex was previously a common host for Subversion repositories.

Subversion was created by CollabNet Inc. in 2000, and is now a top-level Apache project being built and used
by a global community of contributors.

CollabNet founded the Subversion project in 2000 as an effort to write an open-source version-control system
which operated much like CVS but which fixed the bugs and supplied some features missing in CVS. By 2001,
Subversion had advanced sufficiently to host its own source code, and in February 2004, version 1.0 was released.
In November 2009, Subversion was accepted into Apache Incubator: this marked the beginning of the process
to become a standard top-level Apache project. It became a top-level Apache project on February 17, 2010.
