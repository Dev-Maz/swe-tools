Sublime Text is a text and source code editor featuring a minimal interface, syntax highlighting and code folding
with native support for numerous programming and markup languages, search and replace with support for regular expressions,
an integrated terminal/console window, and customizable themes. Available for Windows, macOS, and Linux, its functionality
can be expanded with plugins written in Python. Community-contributed plugins can be downloaded and installed via
a built-in Package Control system, or written by the user via a Python API. Sublime Text is proprietary software,
but can be downloaded for free and used as an evaluation version with no time limit.

Features of Sublime Text include quick navigation to symbols, lines, or project files, a "command palette" with adaptive
matching for quick keyboard invocation of frequently used commands, simultaneous editing, Python-based API for plugins,
project- and syntax-specific preferences, extensive customizability via JSON settings files, including project-specific
and platform-specific settings cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, and Linux) and associated support for writing
cross-platform plugins and support for TextMate language grammars

Package Control is an open source third-party package manager for Sublime Text which allows the user to find, install,
upgrade and remove plug-ins, usually without restarting Sublime Text. The package manager keeps installed packages
up-to-date with an auto-upgrade feature and downloads packages from GitHub, BitBucket and a custom JSON-encoded
channel/repository system. It also handles updating packages cloned from GitHub and BitBucket via Git and Hg, as well
as providing commands for enabling and disabling packages. The package manager also includes a command to bundle
any package directory into a .sublime-package file.

Notable third-party packages include:

- LSP - Support for the Language Server Protocol

- Bracket Highlighter – Enhances the basic highlights Sublime Text provides for bracket pairs

- SublimeLinter – Code linting (validation) for JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, and others

- Sidebar Enhancements – Enhancements to the Sublime Text sidebar with new options for deleting, opening, moving, creating, editing, and finding files
