Notepad++ (sometimes npp or NPP), is a text and source code editor for use with Microsoft Windows. It supports tabbed
editing, which allows working with multiple open files in one window. The program's name comes from the C postfix increment
operator.

Notepad++ is released as free and open-source software under a GNU General Public License (GPL) 3.0 or later. At first,
the project was hosted on the SourceForge software repository (2003–2010), from where it was downloaded over 28 million
times, and twice won the SourceForge Community Choice Award for Best Developer Tool. Then, the project moved to TuxFamily
(2010–2015), and then to GitHub (2015–present). Notepad++ uses the Scintilla editor component.
Notepad++ is a source code editor. It features syntax highlighting, code folding and limited autocompletion for programming,
scripting, and markup languages, but not intelligent code completion or syntax checking. As such, it may properly
highlight code written in a supported schema, but whether the syntax is internally sound or compilable, cannot be verified.
The language list also displays two special-case items for ordinary plain text: "Normal text" (default) or "MS-DOS Style",
which tries to emulate DOS-era text editors.

Notepad++ has features to consume and create cross-platform plain text files. It recognizes three newline representations
(CR, CR+LF, and LF) and can convert between them on the fly. In addition, it supports reinterpreting plain text files
in various character encodings and can convert them to ASCII, UTF-8 or UCS-2. As such, it can fix plain text that seem
gibberish only because their character encoding is not properly detected.

Notepad++ also has features that improve plain text editing experience in general, such as:

- Autosave

- Finding and replacing strings of text with regular expressions

- Searching text strings within opened tabs

- Searching text strings in a directory

- Guided indentation

- Line bookmarking

- Macros

- Simultaneous editing

- Split screen editing and synchronized scrolling

- Line operations, including sorting, case conversion (Uppercase, lowercase, camel case, sentence case), and removal
of redundant whitespace

- Tabbed document interface
