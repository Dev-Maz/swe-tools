Visual Studio Code, commonly referred to as VS Code, is an integrated development environment developed by Microsoft
for Windows, Linux, macOS and web browsers. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent
code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded version control with Git. Users can change the theme,
keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add functionality.

Visual Studio Code is proprietary software released under the "Microsoft Software License", but based on the MIT licensed
program named "Visual Studio Code — Open Source" (also known as "Code — OSS"), also created by Microsoft and available
through GitHub. Open-source binaries are available from VSCodium, without Microsoft's telemetry.

In the Stack Overflow 2023 Developer Survey, Visual Studio Code was ranked the most popular developer environment tool
among 86,544 respondents, with 73.71% reporting that they use it.
Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor that can be used with a variety of programming languages, including C, C#, C++,
Fortran, Go, Java, JavaScript, Node.js, Python, Rust, and Julia. Visual Studio Code employs the same editor component
(codenamed "Monaco") used in Azure DevOps (formerly called "Visual Studio Online" and "Visual Studio Team Services").

The downloadable version of Visual Studio Code is built on the Electron framework, which is used to develop Node.js
web applications that run on the Blink layout engine. Visual Studio Code for the Web is a browser-based version
of the editor that can be used to edit both local files and remote repositories (on GitHub and Microsoft Azure) 
without installing the full program. It is officially supported and hosted by Microsoft and can be accessed at vscode.dev.

Out of the box, Visual Studio Code includes basic support for most common programming languages. This basic support
includes syntax highlighting, bracket matching, code folding, and configurable snippets. Visual Studio Code also ships
with IntelliSense for JavaScript, TypeScript, JSON, CSS, and HTML, as well as debugging support for Node.js.
Support for additional languages can be provided by freely available extensions on the VS Code Marketplace.

Instead of a project system, it allows users to open one or more directories, which can then be saved in workspaces
for future reuse. This allows it to operate as a language-agnostic code editor for any language. It supports many
programming languages and a set of features that differ per language. Unwanted files and folders can be excluded
from the project tree via settings. Many Visual Studio Code features are not exposed through menus or the user interface
but can be accessed via the command palette. The command palette is able to execute virtually every feature the 
graphical interface supports, making it very keyboard-accessible.

Visual Studio Code can be extended via extensions, available through a central repository. This includes additions
to the editor and language support. A notable feature is the ability to create extensions that add support for new languages,
themes, debuggers, time travel debuggers, perform static code analysis, and add code linters using the Language Server 
Protocol.

Source control is a built-in feature of Visual Studio Code. It has a dedicated tab inside of the menu bar where users
can access version control settings and view changes made to the current project. To use the feature, Visual Studio Code
must be linked to any supported version control system (Git, Apache Subversion, Perforce, etc.). This allows users to
create repositories and to make push and pull requests directly from the Visual Studio Code program.

Visual Studio Code collects usage data and sends it to Microsoft to help improve the product. This telemetry feature
can be disabled. The information contained in this telemetry data can be inspected by the public, since the product is
open source.
