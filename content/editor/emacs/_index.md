Emacs, originally named EMACS (an acronym for "Editor Macros") is a family of text editors that are characterized by
their extensibility. The manual for the most widely used variant, GNU Emacs, describes it as "the extensible, customizable,
self-documenting, real-time display editor". Development of the first Emacs began in the mid-1970s, and work on GNU Emacs,
directly descended from the original, is ongoing; its latest version is 29.4 Edit this on Wikidata, released June 2024.

Emacs has over 10,000 built-in commands and its user interface allows the user to combine these commands into macros
to automate work. Implementations of Emacs typically feature a dialect of the Lisp programming language, allowing users and
developers to write new commands and applications for the editor. Extensions have been written to, among other things,
manage files, remote access, e-mail, outlines, multimedia, Git integration, RSS feeds, and collaborative editing, as well
as implementations of ELIZA, Pong, Conway's Life, Snake, Dunnet, and Tetris.

The original EMACS was written in 1976 by David A. Moon and Guy L. Steele Jr. as a set of macros for the TECO editor.
It was inspired by the ideas of the TECO-macro editors TECMAC and TMACS.

The most popular, and most ported, version of Emacs is GNU Emacs, which was created by Richard Stallman for the GNU Project.
XEmacs is a variant that branched from GNU Emacs in 1991. GNU Emacs and XEmacs use similar Lisp dialects and are,
for the most part, compatible with each other. XEmacs development is inactive.

GNU Emacs is, along with vi, one of the two main contenders in the traditional editor wars of Unix culture. GNU Emacs
is among the oldest free and open source projects still under development.
Emacs is primarily a text editor and is designed for manipulating pieces of text, although it is capable of formatting
and printing documents like a word processor by interfacing with external programs such as LaTeX, Ghostscript or a web
browser. Emacs provides commands to manipulate and differentially display semantic units of text such as words,
sentences, paragraphs and source code constructs such as functions. It also features keyboard macros for performing
user-defined batches of editing commands.

GNU Emacs is a real-time display editor, as its edits are displayed onscreen as they occur. This is standard behavior
for modern text editors but EMACS was among the earliest to implement this. The alternative is having to issue a distinct
command to display text, (e.g. before or after modifying it). This was common in earlier (or merely simpler) line
and context editors, such as QED (BTS, CTSS, Multics), ed (Unix), ED (CP/M), and Edlin (DOS).
